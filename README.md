# ball_movement

This web page creates a visually appealing moving ball within a square boundary. The ball moves diagonally, bouncing off the boundaries when it reaches them, creating a perpetual animation. It offers a dynamic and engaging demonstration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration for creating interactive web content.
